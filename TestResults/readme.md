This directory contains test results run on ATV

One temperature test results were run on a x96mini with a 40mm single speed fan installed on it.  Ambient temp of 68°F.  Test conducted while account being leveled in Paris.  Started out with fan on, then turned it off.  Let temperatures reach plateau of 80°C, then kicked the fan back on.

The remaineder of test results are for x96mini in my computer case build.  Seeing as I live in suburbia, they may not stress them as fully as say levling in Paris.
