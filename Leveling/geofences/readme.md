# Geofences for leveling setups

The files in this directory are geofences for leveling setups.  To import, you will need the instance ID you intend to use these on.  Set the variable in the sql file, i.e. replace the ???? with 1 if your instance ID is 1.  Then import the file using a program like HeidiSQL.  You will then have fences in your db.  Make areas, init and set to leveling mode.
