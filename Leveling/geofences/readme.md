# Geofences for leveling setups

The files in this directory are geofences for leveling setups.  To import, you will need the instance ID you intend to use these on.  Set the variable in the sql file, i.e. replace the ?????? with 1 if your instance ID is 1.  Then import the file using a program like HeidiSQL.  You will then have fences in your db.

* Import the stops to db, do note that these are made from around the same time so there may be new stops and dead stops.
* Make areas using fences
  * Set to quick calc mode
  * Set to leveling mode
